Hi Dan!

My project for Udacity was to build a wiki. Users should be able to edit any page if they are logged in. You can access the wiki by going to joshrschwarzapel.appspot.com to play around with it.

I hand built the cookies and password salting/hashing libraries for my own edification, even though I know in real life there are probably awesome off-the-shelf ways of doing this.

The main file is "Wiki.py".
